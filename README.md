Houston and Houston Lite
========================

Scientific programs often still have a command line interface only. Aimed at self-consistent field client software, Houston offers a simple GUI to help novice users in using command line programs.

With Houston you can

-    Prepare your input files
-    Execute the client programs
-    Schedule jobs

With Houston Lite you can only run jobs over the network (access to sfb servers is of course needed). Houston, as opposed to Houston Lite, ships with client software, which makes it posible to use Houston without access to an sfb server.

Version 1.3l
============

The current version is version 1.3l. This version no longer `phones home' and sports the sfb 0.5 remote execution standard.

Licensing
=========

Houston ships with the proprietary sfbox application. An old version is included. You can qualify for obtaining a recent version by contacting prof.F.L.

Houston Lite does not contain any client software and may therefore be downloaded from here.

Both versions of Houston use UDP port 7040 to check for updates. If you don't like this, please don't use Houston.
System Requirements

-    Microsoft Windows 2000 or XP
-    Microsoft .NET Framework Redistributable 2.0
-    Plugin software (Houston only)

Note: Houston Lite is no longer available.
